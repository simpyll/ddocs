title: How To Become A Hacker
---

Learning to become a hacker isnâ€™t easy. There are multiple roadblocks:

1. There is no clear road map to becoming a hacker
2. Lack of technical knowledge
3. Lack of resources
4. Lack of support
5. The complexity of the field

Today I want to change all that. In this guide we are going to discuss how to become a hacker, step by step.
